# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis (Power BI Project)

This project analyzes **customer churn behavior** for a telecom company using **Power BI, Excel, Power Query, and DAX**.  
The goal of this project is to help the business understand:

- **Why customers leave**
- **Who is more likely to churn**
- **Which customer segments are at risk**
- **What actions can reduce churn**

This is a complete end-to-end data analytics project — from data cleaning to dashboard building to insight generation.

## 📌 1. Problem Statement

A telecom company is experiencing a high percentage of customer churn.  
The management wants to understand:

- What drives customers to leave?
- Which locations and demographics have the highest churn?
- How do bill amount, satisfaction score, and tenure influence churn?
- What actions can reduce churn and improve retention?

This project aims to build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to answer these questions clearly.

## 📂 3. Dataset Description

The dataset contains **6,000 rows** of realistic customer data with the following columns:

- **CustomerID** — Unique customer identifier  
- **Churn_Status** — Yes / No

## 🧼 4. Data Cleaning (Excel + Power Query)

I cleaned the dataset using **Excel** and **Power Query**.  
Below are the steps I followed:

- Removed leading & trailing spaces using `TRIM()` / Power Query Trim + Clean  
- Handled missing values:
  - Payment_Method → filled with **UPI** (most common)
  - Age_Group → **Unknown**
  - Gender → **Other**
  - Customer_Satisfaction_Score → filled with **3**
  - Churn_Reason → filled only for churned customers; left blank for non-churned
  - Telecom_Circle → **Unknown**
  - Dependents → **No**
- Fixed numeric issues:
  - Removed `" Rs"` text from numeric columns
  - Converted Monthly_Charges, Total_Charges, Tenure_in_Months to numeric
  - Recalculated `Total_Charges = Monthly_Charges * Tenure_in_Months`
- Standardized categories for Service_Type, Payment_Method, Contract_Type
- Removed duplicates and invalid rows
- Loaded the final clean dataset into Power BI

## 🧮 5. DAX Measures Used

Below are the key DAX measures used in the Power BI report:

**Total Customers**
```dax
Total Customers = COUNTROWS('Telecom Data')
```

**Total Churned Customers**
```dax
Total Churned Customers =
CALCULATE(
  COUNTROWS('Telecom Data'),
  'Telecom Data'[Churn_Status] = "Yes"
)
```

**Churn Rate (%)**
```dax
Churn Rate = DIVIDE([Total Churned Customers], [Total Customers], 0)
```

**Avg Tenure of Churned Customers**
```dax
Avg Tenure of Churned Customers =
CALCULATE(
  AVERAGE('Telecom Data'[Tenure_in_Months]),
  'Telecom Data'[Churn_Status] = "Yes"
)
```

**Avg Monthly Charges of Churned Customers**
```dax
Avg Monthly Charges of Churned Customers =
CALCULATE(
  AVERAGE('Telecom Data'[Monthly_Charges]),
  'Telecom Data'[Churn_Status] = "Yes"
)
```

**Avg Satisfaction Score (Churned Only)**
```dax
Avg Satisfaction Score of Churned Customers =
CALCULATE(
  AVERAGE('Telecom Data'[Customer_Satisfaction_Score]),
  'Telecom Data'[Churn_Status] = "Yes"
)
```
